# Multiplayer FPS Server with Socket.io

This is a simple multiplayer FPS server using **Socket.io** to handle real-time player connections, movements, shooting, and disconnections. Players can move around the game area, shoot at other players, and get notified when another player dies or disconnects.

- **Player Connections:** Players can connect to the game and are assigned unique socket IDs.
